# Setting up
- This is currently running on Godot 4.2
- After you open up the Godot Editor. Goto Editor Settings and tick on `Trim Trailing Whitespace on Save`

# How to play
- Place down a factory for a `Peeple` to work in
- During `Work hours` Peeple will work, gaining resources
- As you gain more resources, you will be able to buy things like houses and more factories!

# About
- This game is an open source idle city builder game. I plan it to be a mix between sim city and an idle game
- The idea is you have `Peeple` and you can make them work, making them work produces resources, resources can be towards upgrades and new buildings. So on and so forth.
